I decided to volunteer at the Vodafone Xone - Otautahi my time was spent to help a cause very close to my heart. Along with Team Te Tihi we developed a great app for rangatahi(youth).

## THE WHAT

The idea behind the app was teaching rangatahi to dream again through collective dreaming. Through the four Te Whare Tapa wha principals: 

Wairua -    Emotional/Spiritual
Tinana -    Physical
Hinengaro - Mental
Whanau -    Family
