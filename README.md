# Te-Mauri-Moemoea

At the Vodafone Xone - Otautahi I volunteered my time to help Te Tihi develope a great app for rangatahi(youth). The idea behind the 
app was teaching rangatahi to dream again through collective dreaming. Through the four Te Whare Tapa wha principals: 

Wairua -    Emotional/Spiritual
Tinana -    Physical
Hinengaro - Mental
Whanau -    Family
